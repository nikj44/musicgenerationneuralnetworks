# musicgenerationneuralnetworks
Created a Music, using Deep Neural Networks. I used Scikit Learn’s MLP Classifier to train the neural network, on the data collected by myself. I collected MiDi files for some music, and then trained the neural Network on the midi notes , and midi chords, both on ‘Pitch’ and ‘Velocity’ as output. I used the midi<-> csv python library, to change the midi notes to csv files, and then cumulated, and cleaned the data, and then used the MLP Classifier. The ‘Time’ was given as input, which was taken randomly.
